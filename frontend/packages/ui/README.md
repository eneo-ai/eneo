# @Intric/ui

Basic UI library based on Melt UI builders.

## Installing

```bash
# Install dependencies, usually all dependencies of the monorepo get installed at once,
# so if you already installed from the base directory you will probably not have to do this
bun install
```

## Developing

Library dev mode is started by

```bash
bun run dev
```

If you want to develop the actual SvelteKit app contained in this package, run instead:

```bash
bun run dev:app
```

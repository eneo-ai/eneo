# About Eneo

Eneo is an open-source AI platform specifically designed for Swedish public sector organizations to deploy and manage AI assistants while maintaining complete control over data, security, and algorithms.

## Our Mission

> **"Generative AI must not be a technology for the few, but a technology for everyone."**

We believe that access to AI technology should be democratic, transparent, and serve the public interest. Eneo embodies this principle by providing an open-source platform that organizations can fully control and customize.

## Origin Story

Eneo was originally developed by **Sundsvall Municipality** and **Ånge Municipality** in Sweden to address a critical need: enabling public sector organizations to leverage AI technology while maintaining data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.

Faced with the challenge of using commercial AI platforms that raised concerns about:
- Data privacy and sovereignty
- Vendor lock-in
- Lack of transparency
- High costs
- Compliance complexity

These municipalities decided to build a solution that would be:
- **Open source** for transparency and community ownership
- **Self-hosted** for complete data control
- **Model agnostic** to avoid vendor lock-in
- **Compliance-ready** with GDPR and EU AI Act built-in
- **Collaborative** allowing municipalities to share improvements

### Building on Success

Eneo draws inspiration from **[Open ePlatform](https://www.openeplatform.org/)**, another successful Swedish municipal open-source project that has been used by over 200 municipalities since 2010. We're applying those same principles of democratic collaboration to AI technology.

## Governance Model

### Democratic Control

Eneo is governed by a **user association of public sector organizations**, ensuring that development priorities align with public interest rather than commercial goals.

**How it works:**
1. Member organizations contribute to development
2. Feature priorities are decided democratically
3. Improvements are shared with all members
4. Costs and resources are shared collectively

### User Association Benefits

- **Influence Development**: Vote on feature priorities
- **Share Knowledge**: Learn from other organizations' experiences
- **Reduce Costs**: Pool resources for development
- **Collaborative Learning**: Access to best practices
- **Collective Bargaining**: Better rates with service providers

**Join the User Association:**

## Technology Philosophy

### Open Source First

Eneo is licensed under **AGPL v3**, ensuring:
- Complete source code transparency
- Right to modify and extend
- Obligation to share improvements
- Community ownership
- No proprietary lock-in

### Data Sovereignty

**Your data, your control:**
- Self-hosted deployment options
- No data transmission to third parties (except your chosen AI providers)
- Complete control over data retention and deletion
- Compliance with local regulations

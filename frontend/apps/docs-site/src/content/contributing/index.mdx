# Contributing to Eneo

Eneo is an open-source project licensed under AGPL v3, and we welcome contributions from the community. However, Eneo's core development is led by a dedicated team with a clear vision for the platform. To keep the project focused and maintainable, all outside contributions must align with Eneo's goals and follow an **issue-first workflow**.

---

## How to Contribute

Every contribution — whether a bug fix, new feature, or improvement — starts with an issue. This ensures alignment before any code is written.

### 1. Check Existing Issues

Before opening a new issue, search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/eneo-ai/eneo/issues) to see if your idea or bug has already been reported.

### 2. Create an Issue

Open a new issue describing the change you'd like to make. Be specific about:

- **What** you want to change or add
- **Why** the change is needed
- **How** you plan to approach it (if you have a proposal)

### 3. Discuss and Get Approval

Wait for feedback from the maintainers. This step is important — it saves you from spending time on work that may not be accepted. Maintainers may suggest a different approach, ask clarifying questions, or confirm that the change is welcome.

### 4. Fork, Implement, and Submit a PR

Once your issue has been discussed and given the green light:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Implement the change
4. Submit a pull request referencing the issue

## What Makes a Good Contribution

Contributions should be **generic** — they must benefit all users of the platform, not just a single organization.

**Good contributions:**

- "Improve vector search performance" — universal improvement
- "Add accessibility features for screen readers" — platform-wide enhancement
- "Implement batch processing for documents" — general capability

**Contributions that won't be accepted:**

- "Add custom branding for Municipality X" — too specific
- "Implement Company Y's approval workflow" — organization-specific
- "Change color scheme to match our brand" — violates design system
- "Add hard-coded integration with our internal system" — not generic

All UI contributions must follow Eneo's established design system and use existing components and patterns. No PR may break existing functionality.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Reference the approved issue** in your PR description
- **Keep the scope focused** — one feature or fix per PR
- **Include tests** for new functionality
- **Follow existing conventions** — code style, project structure, commit message format
- **Update documentation** if your change affects user-facing behavior

### Commit Message Format

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description
```

Examples:

```
feat(assistants): add system prompt validation
fix(spaces): resolve permission check bug
docs(api): update assistant endpoint documentation
```

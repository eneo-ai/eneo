"""
Critical security tests for CredentialResolver strict mode enforcement.

This test suite validates the fix for the multi-tenant isolation bug where
tenants could silently use shared global credentials even in strict mode.

Root Cause (CRITICAL SECURITY BUG):
------------------------------------
The strict mode check was positioned AFTER the global credential fallback,
allowing tenants to bypass tenant-specific credential enforcement.

Fix:
----
Moved strict mode enforcement to BEFORE global fallback in credential_resolver.py
(lines 111-125), ensuring tenants in multi-tenant mode MUST configure their own
credentials and cannot fall back to shared global keys.

Security Impact:
----------------
Without this fix, in a multi-tenant SaaS environment:
- Tenants think they're using their own API keys
- System silently uses shared global credentials
- Causes billing confusion, rate limit sharing, and potential data leakage

These tests are CRITICAL regression guards for this security boundary.

        a ValueError when required fields are missing, rather than silently returning None.
